This package provides managed budgets for Oscar.  It uses double-ledger
accounting to ensure all transaction have a source and destination.

Features:

* A budget can have:
  - No users assigned
  - A single "primary" user
  - A set of users assigned
* A user can have multiple budgets
* A budget can have a start and end date to allow its usage in a limited time
  window
* A budget has a credit limit which defaults to zero.  Budgets can be set up
  with no credit limit.

TODO:

* Make top-level models abstract for extensibility
